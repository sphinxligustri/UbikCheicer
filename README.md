# UbikCheicer
Is pre-sliced cheese not to your liking? Do you want to do your own?

Worry not!

UbikCheicer to the rescue - it revives the thrill of slicing!

Apply your block of cheese on the board and pass it over the wire. It's (che)easy!

A satisfying "pling" sounds after each slice.

UbikCheicer is perfectly safe when used as described in the manual.

ToDo:
* CAD, basic, reasonable, and over engineered versions
* Manual
* Legal / disclaimer
* prototype (should be 60/70s theme)
* product
* commercial
* News paper "facsimile" of unintended use
* protesters opposing this way of cutting cheese
* a sale including an accident, but sale is successful: 
* conspiracy theories?
* experts (talking heads) opining 
* testimonials
* sponsored by ..

I want to see Ubik make the theatres in a 60/70s look and feel.


Disclaimer: 
It works, but you need to slide the block of cheese on a sheet of paper. Orelse it won't easily slide.
It's gratifying to make slices that are perfect for making toast. 
I store slices in pairs in the freezer and they are, usually, easily separated when frozen. Almost perfect when cooking for one.
